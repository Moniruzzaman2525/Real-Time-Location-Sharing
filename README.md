## ✨ Key Features

*   **Real-Time Location Sharing**:
    *   **User A (Sender)**: Broadcasts live GPS coordinates (simulated or real) via SignalR.
    *   **User B (Receiver)**: Displays real-time location updates on an interactive Leaflet map.
    *   Includes a custom `useSignalR` hook, connection tester, and a mock mode for development.
*   **Infinite Scroll User Feed**:
    *   Fetches and displays a paginated list of users from an API.
    *   Uses React Query for data management, caching, and automatic retries.
    *   Features `react-window` for list virtualization, skeleton loaders, and robust error handling.
    *   Automatically scrolls to the top once all data is loaded.
