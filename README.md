# SignalR Real-Time Location & Infinite Scroll App

This project showcases real-time communication with SignalR for live location sharing and an efficient infinite scroll user feed, built with Next.js and React Query.

## ‚ú® Key Features

    *   **User B (Receiver)**: Displays real-time location updates on an interactive Leaflet map.
    *   Includes a custom `useSignalR` hook, connection tester, and a mock mode for development.
*   **Infinite Scroll User Feed**:
    *   Fetches and displays a paginated list of users from an API.
    *   Uses React Query for data management, caching, and automatic retries.
    *   Features `react-window` for list virtualization, skeleton loaders, and robust error handling.
    *   Automatically scrolls to the top once all data is loaded.
